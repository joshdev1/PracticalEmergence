# Practical Emergence
This is a project applying measures of emergence to leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically this project uses the
"practical criteria" for measuring emergence from the paper below. For more information on the MATLAB code
please see the papers accompanying github repository. https://github.com/pmediano/ReconcilingEmergences
